Manual scheduling is time-consuming and prone to conflicts, making it an ideal problem for Artificial Intelligence to solve.\n","\n","This project aims to design and implement an intelligent agent capable of automatically generating class timetables that comply with all institutional rules. The agent formulates the scheduling problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and uses the python-constraint library in Google Colab to search for valid and optimal solutions.\n","The objective is to find the best possible timetable for all classes while ensuring\n","\n","1.No overlapping classes for teachers or students.\n","\n","2.All room and teacher availability constraints are respected.\n","\n","3.Online lessons occur on the same day.\n","\n","4.Each class has at least one lesson on Monday.\n","\n","**2. Agent Design**\n","\n","**Problem Formulation**\n","\n","The timetabling problem is modelled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):\n","\n","1.Variables: Each lesson (class, course, lesson index) and its assigned time and room\n","\n","2.Domains: Possible time slots (1–20) and rooms (“Room”, “Lab01”).\n","\n","3.Constraints: Hard and soft rules defined below.\n","\n","**Variables**\n","\n","Each course has two weekly lessons\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","1.Variable time_t01_UC11_1 → represents the first lesson of course UC11 for class t01.\n","\n","2.Variable room_t01_UC11_1 → represents its room assignment\n","\n","**Domains**\n","\n","1.Time domain: 1-20 timeslots (Monday-Friday, four blocks per day)\n","\n","2.Room domain: {Room, Lab01}\n","\n","**Hard Constraints**\n","\n","1.Each class can have at most three lessons per day\n","\n","2.A teacher cannot teach more than one class in the same timeslot\n","\n","3.Teacher unavailability slots are respected (mike, rob, sue)\n","\n","4.Fixed room constraints are respected (UC14, UC22 → Lab01).\n","\n","5.Online courses (UC21-L2, UC31-L2) must occur on the same day.\n","\n","6.Every class must have at least one Monday lesson.\n","\n","7.Two weekly lessons for the same course occur on different days\n","\n","8.No class or room overlaps\n","\n","**Soft Constraints**\n","\n","1.Lessons should be distributed across approximately four teaching days.\n","\n","2.Lessons for the same day should be consecutive (minimize idle gaps)\n","\n","3.Minimize the number of distinct real rooms used per class\n","\n","**Heuristics Applied**\n","\n","To improve performance and avoid unnecessary search time:\n","\n","1.Forward-checking is used implicitly through domain filtering\n","\n","2.Constraint ordering: critical constraints such as teacher availability and fixed rooms are applied early to prune infeasible branches.\n","\n","3.Iterative deepening: the solver checks up to 40,000 feasible solutions to balance quality and computation time.\n","\n","4.Evaluation function (penalty function): ranks solutions based on soft constraints to select the best timetable among feasible ones.\n","\n","**3.Execution Summary**\n","\n","When running the solver, the agent systematically enumerates possible timetable combinations and filters out those that violate constraints.\n","From all feasible combinations, it evaluates the soft constraints using a penalty function and selects the best (lowest-penalty) solution.\n","\n","**Output summary:**\n","\n","1.Solutions scanned: 40,000 (solver checked up to 40,000 possible timetables)\n","\n","2.Best penalty: 19\n","\n","3.Elapsed time: 17.9 seconds\n","\n","4.Online lessons: Yes → Friday (UC21-L2 and UC31-L2 on the same day\n","\n","5.Monday lesson present: t01, t02, t03\n","\n","This means the agent evaluated 40,000 possible schedules and selected the best one the most balanced timetable that respects all rules.\n","\n","**Timetable Visualization**\n","\n","Each class (t01, t02, t03) has its own grid:\n","\n","1.Rows: Monday to Friday\n","\n","2.Columns: Block_1 to Block_4\n","\n","3.Cells: “UCxx (Room)” or “UCxx (Lab01)” — some tagged “(Online)\n","\n","Each timetable was validated with the built-in verification script to confirm:\n","\n","1.No overlaps (class or teacher)\n","\n","2.Correct online same-day rule\n","\n","3.Monday presence for each class\n","\n","4.All room restrictions respected\n","\n","**Critical Analysis of Results**\n","\n","1.The generated timetables are feasible and realistic; no hard constraint violations.\n","\n","2.The schedule balances lesson distribution across days and minimizes idle time.\n","\n","3.Soft-constraint penalties are minimal (19), indicating high quality.\n","\n","4.Execution time is reasonable (~18 seconds), demonstrating efficiency.\n","\n","5.Online lessons were successfully grouped on Friday, satisfying the key project challenge.\n","\n","**Limitations:**\n","\n","1.The solver uses exhaustive enumeration, which becomes slower with larger datasets.\n","\n","2.The soft constraints are weighted manually; no adaptive optimization.\n","\n","**4. Conclusion**\n","\n","The intelligent timetabling agent successfully created valid and optimized class schedules for the MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence.\n","By formulating the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), it ensured that all institutional rules and restrictions were strictly followed.\n","\n","The project demonstrates the effectiveness of symbolic AI methods — specifically, constraint programming  in solving real world scheduling problems.\n","\n","Outcomes:\n","\n","1.All hard constraints satisfied (availability, rooms, overlaps, online same day, Monday lessons).\n","\n","1.Soft constraints optimized (balanced days, minimal gaps, fewer room switches)\n","\n","2.Achieved a low penalty score (19) after scanning 40,000 possible solutions in under 20 seconds\n","\n","**Tools used:**\n","\n","1.Programming language: Python\n","\n","2.Library: python-constraint\n","\n","3.Platform: Google Colab\n","\n","**Future Improvements:**\n","\n","1.Use heuristic search (e.g., Min-Conflicts, hill-climbing) to find solutions faster\n","\n","2.Implement OR-Tools CP-SAT to scale for larger datasets\n","\n","3.dd a user interface to visualize and edit timetables interactively\n","\n","**5.
